## Introduction

#### YOLOv5 ðŸš€
The YOLOv5 algorithm is a state-of-the-art object detection model known for its speed and accuracy. It can effectively detect objects, including vehicles, in various sizes and orientations, making it ideal for real-time applications. The algorithm is built upon the You Only Look Once (YOLO) architecture and incorporates advancements such as anchor-free bounding box prediction and feature pyramid networks.

#### SSD
SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector) is another popular object detection algorithm that uses a series of convolutional layers to predict bounding boxes and class probabilities at different scales. It offers high detection accuracy and real-time performance, making it suitable for vehicle detection scenarios.
